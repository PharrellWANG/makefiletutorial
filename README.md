# Makefile Tutorial by Example


This is a single page website. It's built by [metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/), and the generated files are in `docs` (picked because Github Pages only supports `/` and `/docs` as directories to serve from).

To run this locally:
- `yarn install`
- ``. ./z_dev.sh``

To deploy:
- ``. ./z_deploy.sh "your git commit msg"``
